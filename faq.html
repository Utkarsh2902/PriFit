      <!-- QA 1 -->
      <button class="question">Q: Do I need a gym membership to do total body workouts?</button>
      <div class="answer fill">
        <p>A: Not at all! Gyms are a great since they provide you with space and equipment to exercise, and let’s not forget the accountability of meeting friends for a workout. However, with the right exercise selection, total body workouts
          can be done at home. Use your body weight or purchase a small set of dumbbells to get started, then see what you need to improve.</p>
      </div>
      <!-- QA 2 -->
      <button class="question">Q: Do I need a personal trainer?</button>
      <div class="answer fill">
        <p>A: Hiring a personal trainer is an excellent choice for beginners. Much of strength training relies on proper form and building confidence at the gym. If you’re just getting started, personal trainers can help guide you in choosing
          the best workouts and foods for your individual body. They’re also a great way to build good diet and exercise habits, since a good trainer will help you troubleshoot schedules and hold you accountable. Once you’re feeling confident, though,
          feel free to break out on your own or ask your trainer for next steps!</p>
      </div>
      <!-- QA 3 -->
      <button class="question">Q: How do I know when to increase the weight?</button>
      <div class="answer fill">
        <p>A: Most strength exercises should include 3 sets of 8-15 reps. If you’re not able to complete 3 sets of 8 reps, try bringing the weight down. If you’re hitting 3 sets of 15 reps without feeling the burn, it’s time to move up (and
          get an extra set in at your new weight!)</p>

      <!-- QA 4 -->
