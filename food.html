      <h2>The Secret is Protein</h2>
      <p>Exercise pushes us to our limits, which can cause muscle fibers to break. In the long term, this is good, since our body repairs our muscles better and stronger than they were before in order to keep up with the exercise. <strong>It's our how muscles grow.</strong>        But our bodies need nutrients to repair the muscles, and the most important nutrient for repairing muscle is protein.</p>
      <p>Protein is a complex combination of amino acids found in foods like <strong>fish, meat, dairy, and eggs.</strong> If you’re vegan, protein can also be found in moderate amounts in <strong>quinoa, amaranth, legumes, and peas.</strong></p>

      <h2>The Other Secret is Timing</h2>
      <p>It’s not just what you eat, but <em>when</em> you eat as well.</p>
      <p>In order to make the most of your workout, your body will need some energy to burn while at the gym. <strong>45 minutes before</strong> your total body workout, have a small meal consisting of protein and carbs. The carbs will give you fast energy,
        and protein will carry you through the end of your workout.</p>
      <p>After exercising, your body immediately sets to work restoring energy to your muscles and repairing damaged fibers. In order to supply your body with everything it needs, eat a post-workout meal consisting of <strong>whole foods</strong> and <strong>20-40 grams of protein.</strong>        Getting in your post-workout meal will decrease the likelihood of being sore later on, and it’ll increase your ability to recover. Try not to wait too long after a workout to eat—your body needs that protein within <strong>2 hours</strong> of
        exercising to make the most of it.</p>
      <p>Try out these pre- and post-workout meals the next time you exercise!</p>
