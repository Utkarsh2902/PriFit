      <h2>The basics: great exercise, great food</h2>
      <p>It might be tempting to skip all that complex-looking machinery and head straight for the treadmill, but if you do, you’re missing out on the best the gym has to offer. In addition to increased strength and muscle tone, <a href="https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/trainingstation1.htm"
          target="_blank">research shows</a> that an effective strength training program provides a major boost to health, including:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Increased flexibility</li>
        <li>Decreased likelihood of injury</li>
        <li>A boosted metabolism</li>
        <li>Improved posture</li>
        <li>Better sleep</li>
      </ol>
      <p>By supporting your total body workout with well-timed, nutrition-dense foods, you’ll be on your way to slimming down, shaping up, and feeling great every day.</p>

      <h2>The Muscle Groups</h2>

        <figcaption>Common names for the major muscle groups.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The essential principle of a total body workout is just that – exercise your whole body.</p>
      <p>When picking exercises for your workout, it helps to think of your body in sections. Each section is a major muscle group that you’ll target with a selected exercise. To start, pick one exercise for each of the following sections:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Chest</li>
        <li>Back</li>
        <li>Shoulders</li>
        <li>Biceps</li>
        <li>Triceps</li>
        <li>Thighs</li>
        <li>Glutes</li>
        <li>Abs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can do your exercises in any order, but it’s a good idea to keep tabs on how you feel as the workout progresses. Even though each exercise targets a specific muscle group or two, the rest of your body is still working to keep you stable when
        you move. If your arms are getting tired, try an exercise that focuses on your legs next so your arms can rest!</p>

      <h2>An Example Workout</h2>
      <p>Once you’ve selected an exercise, you’ll want to do <strong>3 sets</strong> of <strong>8-15 repetitions</strong> for each. Each set should be followed by <strong>30-60 seconds of rest,</strong> depending on how you're feeling. If you're new to working
        out, you can rely on <strong>bodyweight</strong> to build up stability. If you’re starting to hit 15 reps without feeling a burn, it’s time to start challenging yourself with <strong>dumbbells.</strong></p>
      <p>Here’s an example workout to help you get started.</p>
